### O (Objective)
Today's learning included the following:
- Course introduction
- Icebreaker activity
- Learning task decomposition
- Method naming
- Brief introduction to streams
- Completed an exercise on task decomposition to find the largest even number
- Created a context map for the multiplication table

### R (Reflective)
Overall, the learning experience was positive, and I received encouraging feedback during the exercises. However, while working on the context map for the multiplication table, I encountered some issues. Specifically, the granularity of the task decomposition was still too broad.

### I (Interpretive)
I will maintain my learning momentum by leveraging positive feedback to stay motivated. The issue with task decomposition arose because my understanding of the overall task was not detailed enough, which made it difficult to break down the task into smaller steps.

### D (Decisional)
In future coding tasks, I will focus more on analyzing the task carefully and paying closer attention to identifying atomic tasks. I will continue practicing the integration of context maps with coding.
